title:  "PGQL 1.2 Specification - 20 February 2019"
permalink: /spec/1.2/
summary: "PGQL is an SQL-like query language for the property graph data model and is based on the paradigm of graph pattern matching,
allowing you to specify patterns that are then matched against vertices and edges in a graph.
Like SQL, PGQL has support for grouping (GROUP BY), aggregation (e.g. MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM), sorting (ORDER BY) and many other familiar constructs.
Furthermore, PGQL has powerful regular expression constructs for reachability and shortest path finding."

# Graph Pattern Matching

## Property graph data model

A property graph has a name, which is a (character) string, and contains:

 - A set of vertices (or nodes).

   - Each vertex has zero or more labels.
   - Each vertex has zero or more properties (or attributes), which are arbitrary key-value pairs.

 - A set of edges (or relationships).

   - Each edge is either directed or undirected.
   - Each edge has zero or more labels.
   - Each edge has zero or more properties (or attributes), which are arbitrary key-value pairs.

Labels as well as names of properties are strings. Property values are scalars such as numerics, strings or booleans.

### Example 1: Student Network

An example graph is:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/student_network.png"  %}

Here, `student_network` is the name of the graph. The graph has three vertices labeled `Person` and one vertex labeled `University`. There are six directed edges that connect the vertices. Three of them go from person to person vertices, and they have the label `knows`. Three others go from person to university vertices and are labeled `studentOf`. The person vertices have two properties, namely `name` for encoding the name of the person and `dob` for encoding the date of birth of the person. The university vertex has only a single property `name` for encoding the name of the university. The edges have no properties.

### Example 2: Financial Transactions

An example graph with financial transactions is:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/financial_transactions.png" %}

Here, `financial_transactions` is the name of the graph. The graph has three types of vertices. Vertices labeled `Person` or `Company` have a property `name`, while vertices labeled `Account` have a property `number`. There are edges labeled `ownerOf` from persons to accounts and from companies to accounts, and there are edges labeled `transaction` from accounts to accounts. Note that only the transaction edges have a property (`amount`).

### Example 3: Paris MÃ©tro

Another example graph is:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/paris_metro.png" %}

Here, `paris_metro` is the name of the graph. The graph has seven vertices that are all labeled `Station`. The vertices are connected by undirected edges labeled `connection`. Each vertex has two properties, `name` and `zone`. Each edge has a single property, `line`.

## Writing simple queries

This section is mostly example-based and is meant for beginning users.

### Vertex patterns

The following query matches all the vertices with the label `Person` and retrieves their properties `name` and `dob`:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/student_network.png"  %}

```sql
SELECT n.name, n.dob
  FROM student_network
 MATCH (n:Person)
```

```
+-----------------------+
| n.name   | n.dob      |
+-----------------------+
| Riya     | 1995-03-20 |
| Kathrine | 1994-01-15 |
| Lee      | 1996-01-29 |
+-----------------------+
```

In the query above:
 - `student_network` is the name of the input graph.
 - `(n:Person)` is a vertex pattern in which `n` is a variable name and `:Person` a label expression.
 - Variable names like `n` can be freely chosen by the user. The vertices that match the pattern are said to "bind to the variable".
 - The label expression `:Person` specifies that we match only vertices that have the label `Person`.
 - `n.name` and `n.dob` are property references. `n.name` and `n.dob` access the properties `name` and `dob` of the vertices that bind to `n`, respectively.

The query produces three results, which are returned as a table. The results are unordered.

### Edge patterns

Edge patterns take the form of arrows like `-[e]->` (match an outgoing edge) and `<-[e]-` (match an incoming edge).

For example:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/student_network.png"  %}

```sql
SELECT a.name, b.name
  FROM student_network
 MATCH (a:Person) -[e:knows]-> (b:Person)
```

```
+---------------------+
| a.name   | b.name   |
+---------------------+
| Kathrine | Riya     |
| Kathrine | Lee      |
| Lee      | Kathrine |
+---------------------+
```

In the above query:
 - `-[e:knows]->` is an edge pattern in which `e` is a variable name and `:knows` a label expression.
 - The arrowhead `->` specifies that the pattern matches edges that are outgoing from `a` and incoming to `b`.

### Label expressions

More complex label expressions are supported through [label disjunction](#label-disjunction). Furthermore, it is possible to [omit a label expression](#omitting-a-label-expression).

#### Label disjunction

The bar operator (`|`) is a logical OR for specifying that a vertex or edge should match as long as it has either of the specified labels.

For example:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/student_network.png"  %}

```sql
SELECT n.name, n.dob
  FROM student_network
 MATCH (n:Person|University)
```

```
+--------------------------+
| n.name      | n.dob      |
+--------------------------+
| Riya        | 1995-03-20 |
| Kathrine    | 1994-01-15 |
| Lee         | 1996-01-29 |
| UC Berkeley | <null>     |
+--------------------------+
```

In the query above, `(n:Person|University)` matches vertices that have either the label `Person` or the label `University`. Note that in the result, there is a `<null>` value in the last row because the corresponding vertex does not have a property `dob`.

#### Omitting a label expression

Label expressions may be omitted altogether. The vertex or edge pattern will then match any vertex or edge, no matter its labels.

For example:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/student_network.png"  %}

```sql
SELECT n.name, n.dob
  FROM student_network
 MATCH (n)
```

```
+--------------------------+
| n.name      | n.dob      |
+--------------------------+
| Riya        | 1995-03-20 |
| Kathrine    | 1994-01-15 |
| Lee         | 1996-01-29 |
| UC Berkeley | <null>     |
+--------------------------+
```

Note that the query gives the same results as before since both patterns `(n)` and `(n:Person|University)` match all the vertices in the example graph.

### Filters on property values

TODO

### Multiple edge patterns

TODO

### Matching the same graph element to different patterns

TODO

### Matching edges in any direction

Any-directional edges match edges in the graph no matter if they are incoming, outgoing, or undirected.

An example query with two any-directional edges is as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM g MATCH (n) -[e1]- (m) -[e2]- (o)
```

Note that in case there are both incoming and outgoing data edges between two data vertices, there will be separate result bindings for each of the edges.

Any-directional edges may also be used inside [common path expressions](#common-path-expressions):

```sql
  PATH two_hops AS () -[e1]- () -[e2]- ()
SELECT *
  FROM g MATCH (n) -/:two_hops*/-> (m)
```

The above query will return all pairs of vertices `n` and `m` that are reachable via a multiple of two edges, each edge being either an incoming or an outgoing edge.

### Matching undirected edges

Undirected edges (in the graph) are matched through [any-directional edge patterns](#matching-edges-in-any-direction).

For example:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/paris_metro.png" %}

```sql
SELECT n.name, m.name
  FROM paris_metro
 MATCH (n:Station) -[e:connection]- (m:Station)
 WHERE e.line = 2
```

```
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| n.name                     | m.name                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Charles de Gaulle - Ãtoile | Pigalle                    |
| Pigalle                    | Charles de Gaulle - Ãtoile |
| Pigalle                    | Gare du Nord               |
| Gare du Nord               | Pigalle                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note that above, each undirected edge matches twice because each station along line 2 (note: `e.line = 2`) binds once to `n` and once to `m`, for each edge. If this is not desired, one can filter out the "duplicates", for example through a filter like `n.name > m.name`:

```sql
SELECT n.name, m.name
  FROM paris_metro
 MATCH (n:Station) -[e:connection]- (m:Station)
 WHERE e.line = 2 AND n.name > m.name
```

```
+--------------------------------------+
| n.name  | m.name                     |
+--------------------------------------+
| Pigalle | Charles de Gaulle - Ãtoile |
| Pigalle | Gare du Nord               |
+--------------------------------------+
```

## Main query structure

The previous section on [writing simple queries](#writing-simple-queries) provided a basic introduction to graph pattern matching. The rest of this document introduces the different functionalities in more detail.

The following is the syntax of the main query structure:

```bash
Query ::= <CommonPathExpressions>?
          <SelectClause>
          <FromClause>?
          <MatchClause>
          <WhereClause>?
          <GroupByClause>?
          <HavingClause>?
          <OrderByClause>?
          <LimitOffsetClauses>?
```

Details of the different clauses of a query can be found in the following sections:

 - [Common Path Expressions](#common-path-expressions) allow for specifying complex reachability queries.
 - The [SELECT](#select) clause specifies what should be returned.
 - The [FROM](#from) clause specifies the name of the input graph.
 - The [MATCH](#match) clause specifies the graph pattern that is to be matched.
 - The [WHERE](#where) clause specifies filters.
 - The [GROUP BY](#group-by) clause allows for creating groups of results.
 - The [HAVING](#having) clause allows for filtering entire groups of results.
 - The [ORDER BY](#order-by) clause allows for sorting of results.
 - The [LIMIT and OFFSET](#limit-and-offset) clauses allow for pagination of results.

## SELECT

In a PGQL query, the SELECT clause defines the data entities to be returned in the result. In other words, the select clause defines the columns of the result table.

The following explains the syntactic structure of SELECT clause.

```bash
SelectClause ::= 'SELECT' 'DISTINCT'? <ExpAsVar> ( ',' <ExpAsVar> )*
               | 'SELECT' '*'

ExpAsVar     ::= <ValueExpression> ( 'AS' <VariableName> )?
```

A `SELECT` clause consists of the keyword `SELECT` followed by either an optional `DISTINCT` modifier and comma-separated sequence of `<ExpAsVar>` ("expression as variable") elements, or, a special character star `*`. An `<ExpAsVar>` consists of:

- A `<ValueExpression>`.
- An optional `<VariableName>`, specified by appending the keyword `AS` and the name of the variable.

Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT n, m, n.age AS age
  FROM g MATCH (n:Person) -[e:friend_of]-> (m:Person)
```

Per each matched subgraph, the query returns two vertices `n` and `m` and the value for property age of vertex `n`.  Note that edge `e` is omitted from the result even though it is used for describing the pattern.

The `DISTINCT` modifier allows for filtering out duplicate results. The operation applies to an entire result row, such that rows are only considered duplicates of each other if they contain the same set of values.

### Assigning variable name to Select Expression

It is possible to assign a variable name to any of the selection expression, by appending the keyword `AS` and a variable name. The variable name is used as the column name of the result set. In addition, the variable name can be later used in the `ORDER BY` clause. See the related section later in this document.

```sql
  SELECT n.age * 2 - 1 AS pivot, n.name, n
    FROM g MATCH (n:Person) -> (m:Car)
ORDER BY pivot
```

### SELECT *

`SELECT *` is a special `SELECT` clause. The semantic of `SELECT *` is to select all the variables in the graph pattern.

Consider the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM g MATCH (n:Person) -> (m) -> (w)
     , (n) -> (w) -> (m)
```

This query is semantically equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT n, m, w
  FROM g MATCH (n:Person) -> (m) -> ()
     , (n) -> (w) -> (m)
```

`SELECT *` is not allowed when the graph pattern has zero variables. This is the case when all the vertices and edges in the pattern are anonymous (e.g. `MATCH () -> (:Person)`).
Futhermore, `SELECT *` in combination with `GROUP BY` is not allowed.

## FROM

The `FROM` clause specifies the name of the input graph to be queried:

```bash
FromClause ::= 'FROM' <GraphName>

GraphName  ::= <IDENTIFIER>
```

For example, the input graph of the following query is `my_graph`:

```sql
  SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name
    FROM my_graph
   MATCH (p:Person)
ORDER BY p.first_name, p.last_name
```

### Default graphs

The `FROM` clause may be omitted if there is a "default graph" such that specifying the graph name inside the query is only redundant.

PGQL itself does not (yet) provide syntax for specifying a default graph. However, PGQL engines like PGX provide APIs like `PgxGraph.queryPgql(..)` that provide a default graph (whose name corresponds to `PgxGraph.getName()`). This in contrast to APIs like `PgxSession.queryPgql(..)` which do not provide default graphs.

If a default graph is provided then the `FROM` clause can be omitted from a query like in this example:

```sql
  SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name
   MATCH (p:Person)
ORDER BY p.first_name, p.last_name
```

## MATCH

In a PGQL query, the `MATCH` clause defines the graph pattern to be matched.

Syntactically, a `MATCH` clause is composed of the keyword `MATCH` followed by a comma-separated sequence of path patterns:

```bash
MatchClause               ::= 'MATCH' <GraphPattern>

GraphPattern              ::= <PathPattern> ( ',' <PathPattern> )*

PathPattern               ::=   <SimplePathPattern>
                              | <ShortestPathPattern>
                              | <TopKShortestPathPattern>

SimplePathPattern         ::= <VertexPattern> ( <PathPrimary> <VertexPattern> )*

VertexPattern             ::= '(' <VariableSpecification> ')'

PathPrimary               ::=   <EdgePattern>
                              | <ReachabilityPathExpression>

EdgePattern               ::=   <OutgoingEdgePattern>
                              | <IncomingEdgePattern>
                              | <AnyDirectionalEdgePattern>

OutgoingEdgePattern       ::=   '->'
                              | '-[' <VariableSpecification> ']->'

IncomingEdgePattern       ::=   '<-'
                              | '<-[' <VariableSpecification> ']-'

AnyDirectionalEdgePattern ::=   '-'
                              | '-[' <VariableSpecification> ']-'

VariableSpecification     ::= <VariableName>? <LabelPredicate>?

VariableName              ::= <IDENTIFIER>
```

A path pattern that describes a partial topology of the subgraph pattern. In other words, a topology constraint describes some connectivity relationships between vertices and edges in the pattern, whereas the whole topology of the pattern is described with one or multiple topology constraints.

A topology constraint is composed of one or more vertices and relations, where a relation is either an edge or a path. In a query, each vertex or edge is (optionally) associated with a variable, which is a symbolic name to reference the vertex or edge in other clauses. For example, consider the following topology constraint:

```sql
(n) -[e]-> (m)
```

The above example defines two vertices (with variable names `n` and `m`), and an edge (with variable name `e`) between them. Also the edge is directed such that the edge `e` is an outgoing edge from vertex `n`.

More specifically, a vertex term is written as a variable name inside a pair of parenthesis `()`. An edge term is written as a variable name inside a square bracket `[]` with two dashes and an inequality symbol attached to it â which makes it look like an arrow drawn in ASCII art. An edge term is always connected with two vertex terms as for the source and destination vertex of the edge; the source vertex is located at the tail of the ASCII arrow and the destination at the head of the ASCII arrow.

There can be multiple path patterns in the `MATCH` clause of a PGQL query. Semantically, all constraints are conjunctive â that is, each matched result should satisfy every constraint in the `MATCH` clause.

### Repeated variables

There can be multiple topology constraints in the `WHERE` clause of a PGQL query. In such a case, vertex terms that have the same variable name correspond to the same vertex entity. For example, consider the following two lines of topology constraints:

```sql
(n) -[e1]-> (m1),
(n) -[e2]-> (m2)
```

Here, the vertex term `(n)` in the first constraint indeed refers to the same vertex as the vertex term `(n)` in the second constraint. It is an error, however, if two edge terms have the same variable name, or, if the same variable name is assigned to an edge term as well as to a vertex term in a single query.

### Alternatives for specifying graph patterns

There are various ways in which a particular graph pattern can be specified.

First, a single path pattern can be written as a chain of edge terms such that two consecutive edge terms share the common vertex term in between. For example:

```sql
(n1) -[e1]-> (n2) -[e2]-> (n3) -[e3]-> (n4)
```

The above graph pattern is equivalent to the graph pattern specified by the following set of comma-separate path patterns:

```sql
(n1) -[e1]-> (n2),
(n2) -[e2]-> (n3),
(n3) -[e3]-> (n4)
```

Second, it is allowed to reverse the direction of an edge in the pattern, i.e. right-to-left instead of left-to-right. Therefore, the following is a valid graph pattern:

```sql
(n1) -[e1]-> (n2) <-[e2]- (n3)
```

Please mind the edge directions in the above query â vertex `n2` is a common outgoing neighbor of both vertex `n1` and vertex `n3`.

Third, it is allowed to ommitg variable names if the particular vertex or edge does not need to be referenced in any of the other clauses (e.g. `SELECT` or `ORDER BY`). When the variable name is omitted, the vertex or edge is an "anonymous" vertex or edge.

Syntactically, for vertices, this result in an empty pair of parenthesis. In case of edges, the whole square bracket is omitted in addition to the variable name.

The following table summarizes these short cuts.

Syntax form | Example
--- | ---
Basic form | `(n) -[e]-> (m)`
Omit variable name of the source vertex | `() -[e]-> (m)`
Omit variable name of the destination vertex | `(n) -[e]-> ()`
Omit variable names in both vertices | `() -[e]-> ()`
Omit variable name in edge | `(n) -> (m)`

### Disconnected graph patterns

In the case the `MATCH` clause contains two or more disconnected graph patterns (i.e. groups of vertices and relations that are not connected to each other), the different groups are matched independently and the final result is produced by taking the Cartesian product of the result sets of the different groups. The following is an example:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM g MATCH (n1) -> (m1), (n2) -> (m2)
```

Here, vertices `n2` and `m2` are not connected to vertices `n1` and `m1`, resulting in a Cartesian product.

### Label predicates

In the property graph model, vertices and edge may have labels, which are arbitrary (character) strings. Typically, labels are used to encode types of entities. For example, a graph may contain a set of vertices with the label `Person`, a set of vertices with the label `Movie`, and, a set of edges with the label `likes`. A label predicate specifies that a vertex or edge only matches if it has ony of the specified labels. The syntax for specifying a label predicate is through a (`:`) followed by one or more labels that are separate by a vertical bar (`|`).

This is explained by the following grammar constructs:

```bash
LabelPredicate ::= ':' <Label> ( '|' <Label> )*

Label          ::= <IDENTIFIER>
```

Take the following example:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM g MATCH (x:Person) -[e:likes|knows]-> (y:Person)
```

Here, we specify that vertices `x` and `y` have the label `Person` and that the edge `e` has the label `likes` or the label `knows`.

A label predicate can be specified even when a variable is omitted. For example:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM g MATCH (:Person) -[:likes|knows]-> (:Person)
```

There are also built-in functions available for labels (see [Built-in Functions](#built-in-functions)):

 - `has_label(element, string)` returns `true` if the vertex or edge (first argument) has the specified label (second argument).
 - `labels(element)` returns the set of labels of a vertex or edge in the case the vertex/edge has multiple labels.
 - `label(element)` returns the label of a vertex or edge in the case the vertex/edge has only a single label.

## WHERE

Filters are applied after pattern matching to remove certain solutions. A filter takes the form of a boolean value expression which typically involves certain property values of the vertices and edges in the graph pattern. The syntactic structure is as follows:


```bash
WhereClause ::= 'WHERE' <ValueExpression>
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT y.name
  FROM g MATCH (x) -> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Jake'
   AND y.age > 25
```

Here, the first filter describes that the vertex `x` has a property `name` and its value is `Jake`. Similarly, the second filter describes that the vertex `y` has a property `age` and its value is larger than `25`. Here, in the filter, the dot (`.`) operator is used for property access. For the detailed syntax and semantic of expressions, see [Functions and Expressions](#functions-and-expressions).

Note that the ordering of constraints does not have an affect on the result, such that query from the previous example is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT y.name
 FROM g MATCH (x) -> (y)
WHERE y.age > 25
  AND x.name = 'Jake'
```

# Grouping and Aggregation

## GROUP BY

`GROUP BY` allows for grouping of solutions and is typically used in combination with aggregates like `MIN` and `MAX` to compute aggregations over groups of solutions.

The following explains the syntactic structure of the `GROUP BY` clause:

```bash
GroupByClause ::= 'GROUP' 'BY' <ValueExpression> ( ',' <ValueExpression> )*
```

The `GROUP BY` clause starts with the keywords GROUP BY and is followed by a comma-separated list of value expressions that can be of any type.

Consider the following query:

```sql
  SELECT n.first_name, COUNT(*), AVG(n.age)
    FROM g MATCH (n:Person)
GROUP BY n.first_name
```

Matches are grouped by their values for `n.first_name`. For each group, the query selects `n.first_name` (i.e. the group key), the number of solutions in the group (i.e. `COUNT(*)`), and the average value of the property age for vertex n (i.e. `AVG(n.age)`).

### Multiple Terms in GROUP BY

It is possible that the `GROUP BY` clause consists of multiple terms. In such a case, matches are grouped together only if they hold the same result for each of the group expressions.

Consider the following query:

```sql
  SELECT n.first_name, n.last_name, COUNT(*)
    FROM g MATCH (n:Person)
GROUP BY n.first_name, n.last_name
```

Matches will be grouped together only if they hold the same values for `n.first_name` and the same values for `n.last_name`.

### GROUP BY and NULL values

The group for which all the group keys are null is a valid group and takes part in further query processing.

To filter out such a group, use a `HAVING` clause (see [HAVING](#filtering-of-groups-having)), for example:

```sql
  SELECT n.prop1, n.prop2, COUNT(*)
    FROM g MATCH (n)
GROUP BY n.prop1, n.prop2
  HAVING n.prop1 IS NOT NULL AND n.prop2 IS NOT NULL
```

### Repetition of Group Expression in Select or Order Expression

Group expressions may be repeated in select or order expressions.

Consider the following query:

```sql
  SELECT n.age, COUNT(*)
    FROM g MATCH (n)
GROUP BY n.age
ORDER BY n.age
```

Here, the group expression `n.age` is repeated in the SELECT and ORDER BY.

## Aggregation

Aggregates `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG` and `SUM` can aggregate over groups of solutions.

The syntax is as follows:

```bash
Aggregation      ::=   <CountAggregation>
                     | <MinAggregation>
                     | <MaxAggregation>
                     | <AvgAggregation>
                     | <SumAggregation>
                     | <ArrayAggregation>

CountAggregation ::=   'COUNT' '(' '*' ')'
                     | 'COUNT' '(' 'DISTINCT'? <ValueExpression> ')'

MinAggregation   ::= 'MIN' '(' 'DISTINCT'? <ValueExpression> ')'

MaxAggregation   ::= 'MAX' '(' 'DISTINCT'? <ValueExpression> ')'

AvgAggregation   ::= 'AVG' '(' 'DISTINCT'? <ValueExpression> ')'

SumAggregation   ::= 'SUM' '(' 'DISTINCT'? <ValueExpression> ')'

ArrayAggregation ::= 'ARRAY_AGG' '(' 'DISTINCT'? <ValueExpression> ')'
```

Syntactically, an aggregation takes the form of aggregate followed by an optional `DISTINCT` modifier and a `<ValueExpression>`.

The following table gives an overview of the different aggregates and their supported input types.

Aggregate Operator | Semantic | Required Input Type
--- | --- | ---
`COUNT` | counts the number of times the given expression has a bound (i.e. is not null). | any type, including vertex and edge
`MIN` | takes the minimum of the values for the given expression. | numeric, string, boolean, date, time (with time zone), or, timestamp (with time zone)
`MAX` | takes the maximum of the values for the given expression. | numeric, string, boolean, date, time (with time zone), or, timestamp (with time zone)
`SUM` | sums over the values for the given expression. | numeric
`AVG` | takes the average of the values for the given. | numeric
`ARRAY_AGG` | takes a set of values and puts them into an array/list | numeric, string, boolean, date, time (with time zone), or, timestamp (with time zone)

### Aggregation with GROUP BY

If a `GROUP BY` is specified, aggregations are applied to each individual group of solutions.

An example is as follows:

```sql
  SELECT AVG(m.salary)
    FROM g MATCH (m:Person)
GROUP BY m.age
```

Here, we group people by their age and compute the average salary for each such a group.

### Aggregation without GROUP BY

If _no_ `GROUP BY` is specified, aggregations are applied to the entire set of solutions.

An example is as follows:

```sql
SELECT AVG(m.salary)
  FROM g MATCH (m:Person)
```

Here, we aggregate over the entire set of vertices with label `Person`, to compute the average salary.

### COUNT(*)

`COUNT(*)` is a special construct that simply counts the number of solutions without evaluating an expression. An example is as follows:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM g MATCH (m:Person)
```

### DISTINCT in aggregation

The `DISTINCT` modifier specifies that duplicate values should be removed before performing aggregation.

For example:

```sql
SELECT AVG(DISTINCT m.age)
  FROM g MATCH (m:Person)
```

Here, we aggregate only over distinct `m.age` values.

## HAVING

The `HAVING` clause is an optional clause that can be placed after a `GROUP BY` clause to filter out particular groups of solutions.
The syntactic structure is as follows:

```bash
HavingClause ::= 'HAVING' <ValueExpression>
```

An example is as follows:

```sql
  SELECT n.name
    FROM g MATCH (n) -[:has_friend]-> (m)
GROUP BY n
  HAVING COUNT(m) > 10
```

This query returns the names of people who have more than 10 friends.


# Sorting and Row Limiting


## ORDER BY

When there are multiple matched subgraph instances to a given query, in general, the ordering between those instances are not defined; the query execution engine can present the result in any order. Still, the user can specify the ordering between the answers in the result using `ORDER BY` clause.

The following explains the syntactic structure of `ORDER BY` clause.

```bash
OrderByClause ::= 'ORDER' 'BY' <OrderTerm> ( ',' <OrderTerm> )*

OrderTerm     ::= <ValueExpression> ( 'ASC' | 'DESC' )?
```

The `ORDER BY` clause starts with the keywords `ORDER BY` and is followed by comma separated list of order terms. An order term consists of the following parts:

 - An expression.
 - An optional ASC or DESC decoration to specify that ordering should be ascending or descending.
     - If no keyword is given, the default is ascending order.

The following is an example in which the results are ordered by property access `n.age` in ascending order:

```sql
  SELECT n.name
    FROM g MATCH (n:Person)
ORDER BY n.age ASC
```

### Multiple Terms in ORDER BY

It is possible that `ORDER BY` clause consists of multiple terms. In such a case, these terms are evaluated from left to right. That is, (n+1)th ordering term is used only for the tie-break rule for n-th ordering term. Note that each term can have different ascending or descending decorator.

```sql
  SELECT f.name
    FROM g MATCH (f:Person)
ORDER BY f.age ASC, f.salary DESC
```

### Data Types for ORDER BY

A partial ordering is defined for the different data types as follows:

- Numeric data values are ordered from small to large.
- Strings are ordered lexicographically.
- Boolean values are ordered such that `false` comes before `true`
- Temporal data types (dates, time, timestamps) are ordered such that earlier points in time come before later points in time.

Vertices and edges cannot be ordered.

## LIMIT and OFFSET

The `LIMIT` puts an upper bound on the number of solutions returned, whereas the `OFFSET` specifies the start of the first solution that should be returned.

The following explains the syntactic structure for the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses:

```bash
LimitOffsetClauses ::=   'LIMIT' <LimitOffsetValue> ( 'OFFSET' <LimitOffsetValue> )?
                       | 'OFFSET' <LimitOffsetValue> ( 'LIMIT' <LimitOffsetValue> )?

LimitOffsetValue   ::=   <UNSIGNED_INTEGER>
                       | <BindVariable>
```

The `LIMIT` clause starts with the keyword `LIMIT` and is followed by an integer that defines the limit. Similarly, the `OFFSET` clause starts with the keyword `OFFSET` and is followed by an integer that defines the offset. Furthermore:
The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses can be defined in either order.
The limit and offset may not be negatives.
The following semantics hold for the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses:
The `OFFSET` clause is always applied first, even if the `LIMIT` clause is placed before the `OFFSET` clause inside the query.
An `OFFSET` of zero has no effect and gives the same result as if the `OFFSET` clause was omitted.
If the number of actual solutions after `OFFSET` is applied is greater than the limit, then at most the limit number of solutions will be returned.

In the following query, the first 5 intermediate solutions are pruned from the result (i.e. `OFFSET 5`). The next 10 intermediate solutions are returned and become final solutions of the query (i.e. `LIMIT 10`).

```sql
SELECT n
  FROM g MATCH (n)
 LIMIT 10
OFFSET 5
```

# Variable-Length Paths

Path queries test for the existence of arbitrary-length paths between pairs of vertices, or, retrieve actual paths between pairs of vertices.

## Quantifiers

Quantifiers in path patterns allow for specifying lower and upper limits on the number of times a pattern should match.

The syntax is as follows:

```bash
GraphPatternQuantifier     ::=   <ZeroOrMore>
                               | <OneOrMore>
                               | <Optional>
                               | <ExactlyN>
                               | <NOrMore>
                               | <BetweenNAndM>
                               | <BetweenZeroAndM>

ZeroOrMore                 ::= '*'

OneOrMore                  ::= '+'

Optional                   ::= '?'

ExactlyN                   ::= '{' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> '}'

NOrMore                    ::= '{' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> ',' '}'

BetweenNAndM               ::= '{' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> ',' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> '}'

BetweenZeroAndM            ::= '{' ',' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> '}'
```

The meaning of the different quantifiers is:

| quantifier | meaning                              | matches                                                                                                                             | example path        |
|------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| *          | zero (0) or more                     | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by zero or more matches of a given pattern.                             | `-/:lbl*/->`        |
| +          | one (1) or more                      | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by one or more matches of a given pattern.                              | `-/:lbl+/->`        |
| ?          | zero or one (1), i.e. "optional"     | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by zero or one matches of a given pattern.                              | `-/:lbl?/->`        |
| { n }      | exactly _n_                          | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by exactly _n_ matches of a given pattern.                              | `-/:lbl{2}/->`      |
| { n, }     | _n_ or more                          | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by at least _n_ matches of a given pattern.                             | `-/:lbl{2,}/->`     |
| { n, m }   | between _n_ and _m_ (inclusive)      | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by at least _n_ and at most _m_ (inclusive) matches of a given pattern. | `-/:lbl{2,3}/->                      ` |
| { , m }    | between zero (0) and _m_ (inclusive) | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by at least 0 and at most _m_ (inclusive) matches of a given pattern.   | `-/:lbl{,3}/->`     |

Paths considered include those that repeat the same vertices and/or edges multiple times. This means that even cycles are considered.

## Reachability

In graph reachability we test for the existence of paths (true/false) between pairs of vertices. PGQL uses forward slashes (`-/` and `/->`) instead of square brackets (`-[` and `]->`) to indicate reachability semantic.

The syntax is:

```bash
ReachabilityPathExpression ::=   <OutgoingPathPattern>
                               | <IncomingPathPattern>

OutgoingPathPattern        ::= '-/' <PathSpecification> '/->'

IncomingPathPattern        ::= '<-/' <PathSpecification> '/-'

PathSpecification          ::=   <LabelPredicate>
                               | <PathPredicate>

PathPredicate              ::= ':' <Label> <GraphPatternQuantifier>?
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT c.name
  FROM g MATCH (c:Class) -/:subclass_of*/-> (arrayList:Class)
 WHERE arrayList.name = 'ArrayList'
```

Here, we find all classes that are a subclass of `'ArrayList'`. The regular path pattern `subclass_of*` matches a path consisting of zero or more edges with the label `subclass_of`. Because the pattern may match a path with zero edges, the two query vertices can be bound to the same data vertex if the data vertex satisfies the constraints specified in both source and destination vertices (i.e. the vertex has a label `Class` and a property `name` with a value `ArrayList`).

### Examples with various quantifiers

Take the following graph as example:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/pgql_min_max_hop.png" %}

#### Zero or more

The following query finds all vertices `y` that can be reached from `Amy` by following zero or more `likes` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
  FROM g MATCH (x:Person) -/:likes*/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Amy'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Amy    |
| John   |
| Albert |
| Judith |
+--------+
```

Note that here, `Amy` is returned since `Amy` connects to `Amy` by following zero `likes` edges. In other words, there exists an empty path for the vertex pair.
For `Judith`, there exist two paths (`100 -> 200 -> 300 -> 400` and `100 -> 400`). However, `Judith` is still only returned once since the semantic of `-/ .. /->` is to test for the existence of paths between pairs of vertices (i.e. "reachability"), so there is only at most one result per pair of vertices.

#### One or more

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Amy` by following one or more `likes` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
  FROM g MATCH (x:Person) -/:likes+/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Amy'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| John   |
| Albert |
| Judith |
+--------+
```

This time, `Amy` is not returned since there does not exist a path that connects `Amy` to `Amy` that has a length greater than zero.

Another example is a query that finds all people that can be reached from `Judith` by following one or more `knows` edges:

```sql
SELECT y.name
  FROM g MATCH (x:Person) -/:knows+/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Judith'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Jonas  |
| Judith |
+--------+
```

Here, in addition to `Jonas`, `Judith` is returned since there exist paths from `Judith` back to `Judith` that has a length greater than zero. Examples of such paths are `400 -> 500 -> 400` and `400 -> 500 -> 400 -> 500 -> 400`.

#### Optional

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Judith` by following zero or one `knows` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
  FROM g MATCH (x:Person) -/:knows?/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Judith'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Judith |
| Jonas  |
+--------+
```

Here, `Judith` is returned since there exists the empty path that starts in `400` and ends in `400`. `Jonas` is returned because of the following path that has length one: `400 -> 500`.

#### Exactly n

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Amy` by following exactly two `likes` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
  FROM g MATCH (x:Person) -/:likes{2}/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Amy'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Albert |
+--------+
```

Here, `Albert` is returned since there exists the following path that has `likes` edges only: `100 -> 200 -> 300`.

#### n or more

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Amy` by following 2 or more `likes` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
  FROM g MATCH (x:Person) -/:likes{2,}/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Amy'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Albert |
| Judith |
+--------+
```
Here, `Albert` is returned since there exists the following path of length two: `100 -> 200 -> 300`. `Judith` is returned since there exists a path of length three: `100 -> 200 -> 300 -> 400`.

#### Between n and m

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Amy` by following between 1 and 2 `likes` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
  FROM g MATCH (x:Person) -/:likes{1,2}/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Amy'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| John   |
| Albert |
| Judith |
+--------+
```

Here, `John` is returned since there exists a path of length one (i.e. `100 -> 200`);
`Albert` is returned since there exists a path of length two (i.e. `100 -> 200 -> 300`);
`Judith` is returned since there exists a path of length one (i.e. `100 -> 400`).

#### Between zero and m

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Judith` by following at most 2 `knows` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
  FROM g MATCH (x:Person) -/:knows{,2}/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Judith'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Jonas  |
| Judith |
+--------+
```

Here, `Jonas` is returned since there exists a path of length one (i.e. `400 -> 500`).
For `Judith`, there exists an empty path of length zero (i.e. `400`) as well as a non-empty path of length two (i.e. `400 -> 500 -> 400`).
Yet, `Judith` is only returned once.

### Common Path Expressions

One or more "common path expression" may be declared at the beginning of the query. These can be seen as macros that allow for expressing complex regular expressions.

```bash
CommonPathExpressions ::= <CommonPathExpression>+

CommonPathExpression  ::= 'PATH' <IDENTIFIER> 'AS' <PathPattern> <WhereClause>?
```

A path pattern declaration starts with the keyword `PATH`, followed by an expression name, the assignment operator `AS`, and a path pattern consisting of at least one vertex. The syntactic structure of the path pattern is the same as a path pattern in the `MATCH` clause.

An example is as follows:

```sql
  PATH has_parent AS () -[:has_father|has_mother]-> (:Person)
SELECT ancestor.name
  FROM g MATCH (p1:Person) -/:has_parent+/-> (ancestor)
             , (p2:Person) -/:has_parent+/-> (ancestor)
 WHERE p1.name = 'Mario'
   AND p2.name = 'Luigi'
```

The above query finds common ancestors of `Mario` and `Luigi`.

Another example is as follows:

```sql
  PATH connects_to AS (:Generator) -[:has_connector]-> (c:Connector) <-[:has_connector]- (:Generator)
                WHERE c.status = 'OPERATIONAL'
SELECT generatorA.location, generatorB.location
  FROM g MATCH (generatorA) -/:connects_to+/-> (generatorB)
```

The above query outputs all generators that are connected to each other via one or more connectors that are all operational.

## Shortest Path

`SHORTEST` allows for matching a shortest path (i.e. minimal number of edges) between a source vertex and a destination vertex. In case multiple shortest paths exist, an arbitrary one is retrieved.

The syntax is:

```bash
ShortestPathPattern                ::= 'SHORTEST' '(' <SourceVertexPattern>
                                                              <QuantifiedShortestPathPrimary>
                                                                <DestinationVertexPattern> ')'

SourceVertexPattern                ::= <VertexPattern>

DestinationVertexPattern           ::= <VertexPattern>

QuantifiedShortestPathPrimary      ::= <ShortestPathPrimary> <GraphPatternQuantifier>?

ShortestPathPrimary                ::=   <EdgePattern>
                                       | <ParenthesizedPathPatternExpression>

ParenthesizedPathPatternExpression ::= '(' <VertexPattern>? <EdgePattern> <VertexPattern>? <WhereClause>? ')'
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT src, SUM(e.weight), dst
  FROM g
 MATCH SHORTEST ( (src) -[e]->* (dst) )
 WHERE src.age < dst.age
```

Another example is:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/financial_transactions.png" %}

```sql
  SELECT COUNT(e) AS num_hops
       , p1.name AS start
       , ARRAY_AGG ( CASE label(dst)
                     WHEN 'Account' THEN CAST(dst.number AS STRING)
                     ELSE dst.name END
                   ) AS path
    FROM financial_transactions
   MATCH SHORTEST ( (p1:Person) (-[e]- (dst))* (p2:Person) )
   WHERE p1.name = 'Camille' AND p2.name = 'Liam'
ORDER BY num_hops
```

```
+------------------------------------------+
| num_hops | start   | path                |
+------------------------------------------+
| 3        | Camille | [10039, 8021, Liam] |
+------------------------------------------+
```

Filters along the path vertex/edge are also supported. For example the following query will only consider path containing edges with weight
greater than 10 when generating the shortest path:

```sql
SELECT src, ARRAY_AGG(e.weight), dst
  FROM g
 MATCH SHORTEST ( (src) ((v1)-[e]->(v2) WHERE e.weight > 10)* (dst) )
```

For the case of filters involving aggregations over the path:

```sql
SELECT src, ARRAY_AGG(e.weight), dst
  FROM g
 MATCH SHORTEST ( (src) ((v1)-[e]->(v2))* (dst) ) WHERE SUM(e.cost) < 100
```

we have a slightly different semantic. The filter is applied once the top 3 shortest paths are already generated and not
during their construction.

## Top-K Shortest Path

`TOP` k `SHORTEST` path matches the k shortest paths for each pair of source and destination vertices. Aggregations can then be computed over their vertices/edges.

The syntax is:

```bash
TopKShortestPathPattern ::= 'TOP' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> <ShortestPathPattern>
```

For example the following query will output the sum of the edge weights along each of the top 3 shortest paths between
each of the matched source and destination pairs:

```sql
SELECT src, SUM(e.weight), dst
  FROM g
 MATCH TOP 3 SHORTEST ( (src) -[e]->* (dst) )
 WHERE src.age < dst.age
```

Notice that the sum aggregation is computed for every matching path. In other words the number of rows returned by the
previous query is equal to the number of matching paths which is at most 3 times the number of matching source and
destination pairs.


The `ARRAY_AGG` construct allows users to output properties of edges/vertices along the path. For example, in the following query:

```sql
SELECT src, ARRAY_AGG(e.weight), ARRAY_AGG(v1.age), ARRAY_AGG(v2.age), dst
  FROM g
 MATCH TOP 3 SHORTEST ( (src) ((v1) -[e]-> (v2))* (dst) )
 WHERE src.age < dst.age
```

the `ARRAY_AGG(e.weight)` outputs a list containing the weight property of all the edges along the path,

the `ARRAY_AGG(v1.cost)` outputs a list containing the age property of all the vertices along the path except the last one,

the `ARRAY_AGG(v2.cost)` outputs a list containing the age property of all the vertices along the path except the first one.


Users can also compose shortest path constructs with other matching operators:

```sql
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(e1.weight), ARRAY_AGG(e2.weight)
  FROM g
 MATCH (start) -> (src)
     , TOP 3 SHORTEST ( (src) (-[e1]->)* (mid) )
     , SHORTEST ( (mid) (-[e2]->)* (dst) )
     , (dst) -> (end)
```

Here are more examples:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/financial_transactions.png" %}


```sql
SELECT COUNT(e) AS num_hops
     , SUM(e.amount) AS total_amount
     , ARRAY_AGG(e.amount) AS amounts_along_path
  FROM financial_transactions
 MATCH TOP 7 SHORTEST ( (a:Account) -[e:transaction]->* (b:Account) )
 WHERE a.number = 10039 AND a = b
ORDER BY num_hops, total_amount
```

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| num_hops | total_amount | amounts_along_path                                               |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0        | <null>       | <null>                                                           |

| 4        | 23900.2      | [1000.0, 3000.7, 9999.5, 9900.0]                                 |
| 8        | 44799.6      | [1000.0, 1500.3, 9999.5, 9900.0, 1000.0, 1500.3, 9999.5, 9900.0] |

# Functions and Expressions

Value expressions are used in various parts of the language, for example, to filter solutions (`WHERE` and `HAVING`), to project out computed values (`SELECT`), or, to group by or order by computed values (`GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`).

The following are the relevant grammar rules:

```bash
ValueExpression          ::=   <VariableReference>
                             | <PropertyAccess>
                             | <Literal>
                             | <BindVariable>
                             | <ArithmeticExpression>
                             | <RelationalExpression>
                             | <LogicalExpression>
                             | <BracketedValueExpression>
                             | <FunctionInvocation>
                             | <Aggregation>
                             | <ExtractFunction>
                             | <IsNullPredicate>
                             | <IsNotNullPredicate>
                             | <CastSpecification>
                             | <CaseExpression>
                             | <InPredicate>
                             | <NotInPredicate>
                             | <ExistsPredicate>
                             | <ScalarSubquery>

VariableReference        ::= <VariableName>

PropertyAccess           ::= <VariableReference> '.' <PropertyName>

PropertyName             ::= <IDENTIFIER>

BracketedValueExpression ::= '(' <ValueExpression> ')'
```

A value expression is one of:

 - A variable reference, being either a reference to a `<VertexPattern>`, an `<EdgePattern>`, or, an `<ExpAsVar>`.
 - A property access, which syntactically takes the form of a variable reference, followed by a dot (`.`) and the name of a property.
 - A literal (see [Literals](#literals)).
 - A bind variable (see [Bind Variables](#bind-variables)).
 - An arithmetic, relational, or, logical expression (see [Operators](#operators)).
 - A bracketed value expression, which syntactically takes the form of a value expression between rounded brackets. The brackets allow for controlling precedence.
 - A function invocation (see [Functions](#functions)).
 - The `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` predicates (see [IS NULL and IS NOT NULL](#is-null-and-is-not-null)).
 - The `EXISTS` predicate (see [EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries](#exists-and-not-exists-subqueries)).
 - An aggregation (see [Aggregation](#aggregation)).

## Data Types and Literals

### Data Types

The following is a list of data types in PGQL

 - `STRING`
 - `NUMERIC` (e.g. `INT`/`INTEGER`, `LONG`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`)
 - `BOOLEAN`
 - `DATE`
 - `TIME`
 - `TIMESTAMP`
 - `TIME WITH TIME ZONE`
 - `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`

### Literals

Syntax for the corresponding literals is as follows:

```bash
Literal                      ::=   <StringLiteral>
                                 | <NumericLiteral>
                                 | <BooleanLiteral>
                                 | <DateLiteral>
                                 | <TimeLiteral>
                                 | <TimestampLiteral>
                                 | <TimeWithTimeZoneLiteral>
                                 | <TimestampWithTimeZoneLiteral>

StringLiteral                ::= <SINGLE_QUOTED_STRING>

NumericLiteral               ::=   <UNSIGNED_INTEGER>
                                 | <UNSIGNED_DECIMAL>

BooleanLiteral               ::=   'true'
                                 | 'false'

DateLiteral                  ::= 'DATE' "'" <yyyy-MM-dd> "'"

TimeLiteral                  ::= 'TIME' "'" <HH:mm:ss> "'"

TimestampLiteral             ::= 'TIMESTAMP' "'" <yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss> "'"

TimeWithTimeZoneLiteral      ::= 'TIME' "'" <HH:mm:ss+HH:MM> "'"

TimestampWithTimeZoneLiteral ::= 'TIMESTAMP' "'" <yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss+HH:MM> "'"
```

For example:

| Literal type             | Example literal                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| string                   | `'Clara'`                               |
| integer                  | `12`                                    |
| decimal                  | `12.3`                                  |
| boolean                  | `true`                                  |
| date                     | `DATE '2017-09-21'`                     |
| time                     | `TIME '16:15:00'`                       |
| timestamp                | `TIMESTAMP '2017-09-21 16:15:00'`       |
| time with time zone      | `TIME '16:15:00+01:00'`                 |
| timestamp with time zone | `TIMESTAMP '2017-09-21 16:15:00-03:00'` |

Note that according to the grammar rules, numeric literals (integer and decimal) are unsigned. However, signed values can be generated by using the unary minus operator (`-`).

### Bind Variables

In place of a literal, one may specify a bind variable (`?`). This allows for specifying parameterized queries.

```bash
BindVariable ::= '?'
```

An example query with two bind variables is as follows:

```sql
SELECT n.age
  FROM g MATCH (n)
 WHERE n.name = ?
    OR n.age > ?
```

In the following query, bind variables are used in `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`:

```sql
  SELECT n.name, n.age
    FROM g MATCH (n)
ORDER BY n.age
   LIMIT ?
  OFFSET ?
```

The following example shows a bind variable in the position of a label:

```sql
  SELECT n.name
    FROM g MATCH (n)
   WHERE has_label(n, ?)
```


## Operators

### Arithmetic, Relational and Logical Operators

The following table is an overview of the operators:

Operator kind | Operator
------------- | --------
Arithmetic    | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `-` (unary minus)
Relational    | `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
Logical       | `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`

The corresponding grammar rules are:

```bash
ArithmeticExpression ::=   <UnaryMinus>
                         | <Multiplication>
                         | <Division>
                         | <Modulo>
                         | <Addition>
                         | <Subtraction>

UnaryMinus           ::= '-' <ValueExpression>

Multiplication       ::= <ValueExpression> '*' <ValueExpression>

Division             ::= <ValueExpression> '/' <ValueExpression>

Modulo               ::= <ValueExpression> '%' <ValueExpression>

Addition             ::= <ValueExpression> '+' <ValueExpression>

Subtraction          ::= <ValueExpression> '-' <ValueExpression>

RelationalExpression ::=   <Equals>
                         | <NotEquals>
                         | <Greater>
                         | <Less>
                         | <GreaterEqual>
                         | <LessEquals>

Equals               ::= <ValueExpression> '=' <ValueExpression>

NotEquals            ::= <ValueExpression> '<>' <ValueExpression>

Greater              ::= <ValueExpression> '>' <ValueExpression>

Less                 ::= <ValueExpression> '<' <ValueExpression>

GreaterEqual         ::= <ValueExpression> '>=' <ValueExpression>

LessEquals           ::= <ValueExpression> '<=' <ValueExpression>

LogicalExpression    ::=   <Not>
                         | <And>
                         | <Or>

Not                  ::= 'NOT' <ValueExpression>

And                  ::= <ValueExpression> 'AND' <ValueExpression>

Or                   ::= <ValueExpression> 'OR' <ValueExpression>
```

The supported input types and corresponding return types are as follows:

Operator                                            | type of A (and B)                                                                                     | Return Type
--------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------
A `+` B<br>A `-` B<br>A `*` B<br>A `/` B<br>A `%` B | numeric                                                                                               | numeric*
`-`A (unary minus)                                  | numeric                                                                                               | type of A
A `=` B<br>A `<>` B                                 | numeric, string, boolean,<br>date, time (with time zone), timestamp (with time zone),<br>vertex, edge | boolean
A `<` B<br>A `>` B<br>A `<=` B<br>A `>=` B          | numeric, string, boolean,<br>date, time (with time zone), timestamp (with time zone)                  | boolean
`NOT` A<br>A `AND` B<br>A `OR` B                    | boolean                                                                                               | boolean

*For precision and scale, see [Type Coercion](#type-coercion).

Binary operations are only allowed if both operands are of the same type, with the following two exceptions:

- _time_ values can be compared to _time with time zone_ values
- _timestamp_ values can be compared to _timestamp with time zone_ values

To compare such _time(stamp) with time zone_ values to other time(stamp) values (with or without time zone), values are first normalized to have the same time zone, before they are compared.
Comparison with other operand type combinations, such as dates and timestamp, is not possible. However, it is possible to cast between e.g. dates and timestamps (see [CAST Function](#cast-function)).

### Operator Precedence

Operator precedences are shown in the following list, from the highest precedence to the lowest. An operator on a higher level (e.g. level 1) is evaluated before an operator on a lower level (e.g. level 2).

Level | Operator Precedence
----- | ---
1     | `-` (unary minus)
2     | `*`, `/`, `%`
3     | `+`, `-`
4     | `=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
5     | `NOT`
6     | `AND`
7     | `OR`

### Type Coercion

Performing arithmetic operations with different numeric types will lead to implicit type conversion (i.e. coercion).
Coercion is only defined for numeric types. Given a binary arithmetic operation (i.e. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), the rules are as follows:

 - If both operands are exact numerics (e.g. integer or long), then the result is also an exact numeric with a scale that is at least as large as the scales of each operand.
 - If one or both of the operands is approximate numeric (e.g. float, double), the result is an approximate numeric with a scale that is at least as large as the scales of each operand. The precision will also be at least as high as the precision of each operand.

## Null values

The property graph data model does not allow properties with `null` value. Instead, missing or undefined data can be modeled through the _absence_ of properties.
A `null` value is generated when trying to access a property of a vertex or edge wile the property appears to be missing.
Three-valued logic applies when `null` values appear in computation.

### Three-Valued Logic

An operator returns `null` if one of its operands yields `null`, with an exception for `AND` and `OR`. This is shown in the following table:

Operator                        | Result when A is null                         | Result when B is null                          | Result when A and B are null
------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------
A `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` B         | `null`                                        | `null`                                         | `null`
`-` A                           | `null`                                        | N/A                                            | N/A
A `=` `<>` `>` `<` `>=` `<=` B  | `null`                                        | `null`                                         | `null`
A `AND` B                       | `false` if B yields `false`, `null` otherwise | `false` if A yields `false`, `null` otherwise  | `null`
A `OR` B                        | `true` if B yields `true`, `null` otherwise   | `true` if A yields `true`, `null` otherwise    | `null`
`NOT` A                         | `null`                                        | N/A                                            | N/A

Note that from the table it follows that `null = null` yields `null` and not `true`.

### IS NULL and IS NOT NULL

To test whether a value exists or not, one can use the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` constructs.

```bash
IsNullPredicate    ::= <ValueExpression> 'IS' 'NULL'

IsNotNullPredicate ::= <ValueExpression> 'IS' 'NOT' 'NULL'
```

An example is as follows:

```sql
SELECT n.name
  FROM g MATCH (n)
 WHERE n.name IS NOT NULL
```

Here, we find all the vertices in the graph that have the property `name` and then return the property.

## String functions

### JAVA_REGEXP_LIKE

The JAVA_REGEXP_LIKE returns whether the string matches the given [Java regular expression pattern](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html).

The syntax is:

```
JAVA_REGEXP_LIKE( string, pattern )
```

For example:

```sql
JAVA_REGEXP_LIKE('aaaaab', 'a*b')
Result: true
```

## Numeric functions

### ABS

The ABS function returns the absolute value of a number.
The function returns the same datatype as the numeric datatype of the argument.

The syntax is:

```
ABS( number )
```

For example:

```sql
ABS(-23)
Result: 23

ABS(-23.6)
Result: 23.6

ABS(-23.65)
Result: 23.65

ABS(23.65)
Result: 23.65

ABS(23.65 * -1)
Result: 23.65
```

### CEIL or CEILING

The CEIL and CEILING functions round the specified number up, and return the smallest number that is greater than or equal to the specified number.
The function returns the same datatype as the numeric datatype of the argument.

The syntax is:

```
CEIL ( number )
CEILING ( number )
```

For example:

```sql
CEIL(3.2)
Result: 4.0

CEIL(2.8)
Result: 3.0

CEIL(3)
Result: 3
```

### FLOOR

The floor function returns the largest integer value that is smaller than or equal to the given argument.
The function returns the same datatype as the numeric datatype of the argument.

The syntax is:

```
FLOOR( number )
```

For example:

```sql
FLOOR(3.2)
Result: 3.0

FLOOR(2.8)
Result: 2.0

FLOOR(3)
Result: 3
```

### ROUND

The round function returns the integer closest to the given argument.
The function returns the same datatype as the numeric datatype of the argument.

The syntax is:

```
ROUND ( number )
```

For example:

```sql
ROUND(3.2)
Result: 3.0

ROUND(2.8)
Result: 3.0

ROUND(3)
Result: 3
```

## Datetime functions

### EXTRACT

The `EXTRACT` function allows for extracting a datetime field, such as a year, month or day, from a datetime value.

The syntactic structure is as follows:

```bash
ExtractFunction ::= 'EXTRACT' '(' <ExtractField> 'FROM' <ValueExpression> ')'

ExtractField    ::=   'YEAR'
                    | 'MONTH'
                    | 'DAY'
                    | 'HOUR'
                    | 'MINUTE'
                    | 'SECOND'
                    | 'TIMEZONE_HOUR'
                    | 'TIMEZONE_MINUTE'
```

The fields `YEAR`, `MONTH` and `DAY` can be extracted from a date, a timestamp, or a timestamp with time zone.

For example:

```sql
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM DATE '2017-02-13')
Result: 2017

EXTRACT(MONTH FROM DATE '2017-02-13')
Result: 2

EXTRACT(DAY FROM DATE '2017-02-13')
Result: 13
```

The fields `HOUR`, `MINUTE` and `SECOND` can be extracted from a time, a timestamp, a time with time zone, or a timestamp with time zone.

For example:

```sql
EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIME '12:05:03.201')
Result: 12

EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM TIME '12:05:03.201')
Result: 5

EXTRACT(SECOND FROM TIME '12:05:03.201')
Result: 3.201
```

The fields `TIMEZONE_HOUR` and `TIMEZONE_MINUTE` can be extracted from a time with time zone or a timestamp with time zone.

For example:

```sql

## Vertex and Edge functions

### ID

The ID functions returns an identifier for the vertex/edge, if one exists.

The syntax is:

```
ID( vertex/edge )
```

### LABELS

The LABELS function returns the set of labels of a vertex or an edge. This function only applies when metadata specifies that the vertex or edge has a set of labels, rather than a single label or no label.
The return type of the function is a set of strings.

The syntax is:

```
LABELS( vertex/edge )
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT LABELS(n)
  FROM g MATCH (n:Employee|Manager)
```

```
+---------------------+
| LABELS(n)           |
+---------------------+
| [Employee]          |
| [Manager]           |
| [Employee, Manager] |
+---------------------+
```

### LABEL

The LABEL function returns the label of a vertex or an edge. This function only applies when metadata specifies that the vertex or edge has a single label, rather than a set of labels or no label.
The return type of the function is a string.

The syntax is:

```
LABEL( vertex/edge )
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT LABEL(e)
  FROM g MATCH (n:Person) -[e]-> (m:Person)
```

```
+----------+
| LABEL(e) |
+----------+
| likes    |
| knows    |
| likes    |
+----------+
```

### HAS_LABEL

The HAS_LABEL functions returns true if the vertex or edge (first argument) has the given label (second argument), and false otherwise.

The syntax is:

```
HAS_LABEL( vertex/edge, string )
```

### ALL_DIFFERENT

The ALL_DIFFERENT function returns true if the provided values are all different from each other, and false otherwise. The function is typically used for specifying that a particular set of vertices or edges are all different from each other. However, the function can be used for values of any data type, as long as the provided values can be compared for equality.

The syntax is:

```
ALL_DIFFERENT( val1, val2, val3, ..., valN )
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT n.id, m.id, o.id
  FROM g MATCH (n) -> (m) -> (o)
 WHERE ALL_DIFFERENT( n, m, o )
```

Note that the above query can be rewritten using non-equality constraints as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM g MATCH (n) -> (m) <- (o) -> (n)
 WHERE n <> m AND n <> o AND m <> o
```

Another example is:

```sql
ALL_DIFFERENT( 1, 2, 3 )
Result: true

ALL_DIFFERENT( 1, 1.0 )
Result: false
```

### IN_DEGREE

The IN_DEGREE function returns the number of incoming neighbors of a vertex. The return type is an exact numeric.

The syntax is:

```
IN_DEGREE( vertex )
```

### OUT_DEGREE

The OUT_DEGREE function returns the number of outgoing neighbors of a vertex.  The return type is an exact numeric.

The syntax is:

```
OUT_DEGREE( vertex )
```

## User-Defined functions

User-defined functions (UDFs) are invoked similarly to built-in functions. For example, a user may have registered a function `math.tan` that returns the tangent of a given angle.
An example invocation of this function is then:

```sql
  SELECT math.tan(n.angle) AS tangent
    FROM g MATCH (n)
ORDER BY tangent
```

The syntax is:

```bash
FunctionInvocation   ::= <PackageSpecification>? <FunctionName> '(' <ArgumentList>? ')'

PackageSpecification ::= <PackageName> '.'

PackageName          ::= <IDENTIFIER>

FunctionName         ::= <IDENTIFIER>

ArgumentList         ::= <ValueExpression> ( ',' <ValueExpression> )*
```

Note that a function invocation has an optional package name, a (non-optional) function name, and, zero or more arguments which are arbitrary value expressions.

Function and package names are case-insensitive such that e.g. `in_degree(..)` is the same as `In_Degree(..)` or `IN_DEGREE(..)`.

If a UDF is registered that has the same name as a built-in function, then, upon function invocation, the UDF is invoked and not the built-in function. UDFs can thus override built-ins.

## CAST

_Implicit_ type conversion is supported for numeric types (see [Type Coercion](#type-coercion)). Other type conversions require _explicit_ conversion through `CAST`.
The syntax is as follows:

```bash
CastSpecification ::= 'CAST' '(' <ValueExpression> 'AS' <DataType> ')'

DataType          ::=   'STRING'
                      | 'BOOLEAN'
                      | 'INTEGER'
                      | 'INT'
                      | 'LONG'
                      | 'FLOAT'
                      | 'DOUBLE'
                      | 'DATE'
                      | 'TIME'
                      | 'TIME WITH TIME ZONE'
                      | 'TIMESTAMP'
                      | 'TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE'
```

Note that the syntax of a data type is one or more identifiers separated by a space, allowing the encoding of data types such as `STRING` and `TIME WITH TIME ZONE`.

For example:

```sql
SELECT CAST(n.age AS STRING), CAST('123' AS INTEGER), CAST('09:15:00+01:00' AS TIME WITH TIME ZONE)
  FROM g MATCH (n:Person)
```

Casting is allowed between the following data types:

| From \ To                | string | exact numeric | approximate numeric | boolean | time | time with time zone | date | timestamp | timestamp with time zone |
|--------------------------|--------|---------------|---------------------|---------|------|--------------------|------|-----------|-------------------------|
| string                   | Y      | Y             | Y                   | Y       | Y    | Y                  | Y    | Y         | Y                       |
| exact numeric            | Y      | M             | M                   | N       | N    | N                  | N    | N         | N                       |
| approximate numeric      | Y      | M             | M                   | N       | N    | N                  | N    | N         | N                       |
| boolean                  | Y      | N             | N                   | Y       | N    | N                  | N    | N         | N                       |
| date                     | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | N    | N                  | Y    | Y         | Y                       |
| time                     | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | Y    | Y                  | N    | Y         | Y                       |
| timestamp                | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | Y    | Y                  | Y    | Y         | Y                       |
| time with time zone      | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | Y    | Y                  | N    | Y         | Y                       |
| timestamp with time zone | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | Y    | Y                  | Y    | Y         | Y                       |

In the table above, `Y` indicates that casting is supported, `N` indicates that casting is not supported, and `M` indicates that casting is supported only if the numeric value is within the precision bounds of the specified target type.

## CASE

The `CASE` predicate returns an expression based on the evaluation of some given Boolean conditions.

There are two types of `CASE` expressions: Simple Case and Searched Case.

The grammar is as follows:

```bash
CaseExpression ::= <SimpleCase> | <SearchedCase>

SimpleCase     ::= 'CASE' <ValueExpression> <WhenClause>+ <ElseClause>? 'END'

SearchedCase   ::= 'CASE' <WhenClause>+ <ElseClause>? 'END'

WhenClause     ::= 'WHEN' <ValueExpression> 'THEN' <ValueExpression>

ElseClause     ::= 'ELSE' <ValueExpression>
```

The Simple Case provides a list of pairs (`WHEN` compare value, `THEN` return value) and optionally
an else clause (`ELSE` else value). PGQL compares a given expression to each compare value and
returns the corresponding return value when compared expressions are equal. If no equal expression
is found and an `ELSE` clause exists, then PGQL returns the given else value. Otherwise, null is
returned.

For example:

```sql
CASE n.age
 WHEN 1 THEN "One"
 WHEN 2 THEN "Two"
 WHEN 3 THEN "Three"
 ELSE "Older than three"
END
```

The Searched Case provides a list of pairs (`WHEN` boolean expression, `THEN` return value) and optionally
an else clause (`ELSE` else value). PGQL evaluates each boolean expression until one of them evaluates
to true, and returns the corresponding return value. If no expression evaluates to true, and an `ELSE`
clause exists, then PGQL returns the given else value. Otherwise, null is returned.

For example:

```sql
CASE
 WHEN n.level = 'user' THEN 0
 WHEN n.authorized THEN 1
 ELSE -1
END
```

## IN and NOT IN

The `IN` and `NOT IN` predicates test a value for membership in a list of values.
The PGQL literal types `INTEGER`, `DECIMAL`, `BOOLEAN`, `STRING`, `DATE`, `TIME (WITH TIME ZONE)`, `TIMESTAMP (WITH TIME ZONE)` are allowed in the list.

The syntactic structure is as follows:

```bash
InPredicate    ::= <ValueExpression> 'IN' <InValueList>

NotInPredicate ::= <ValueExpression> 'NOT' 'IN' <InValueList>

InValueList    ::=   '(' <ValueExpression> ( ',' <ValueExpression> )* ')'
                   | <BindVariable>
```

For example:

```sql
2 IN (2, 3, 5)
Result: true

3.2 IN (5, 4.8, 3.2)
Result: true

false IN (true, true)
Result: false

'Emily' IN ('Emily', 'Carl')
Result: true

DATE '1990-07-03' IN (DATE '1990-07-03', DATE '1993-05-28')
Result: true

TIME '12:00:10' IN (TIME '11:55:10', TIME '06:50:00.999+05:00')
Result: false

TIMESTAMP '2016-03-20 22:09:59.999' IN (TIMESTAMP '2016-03-20 23:09:59')
Result: false
```

Bind variables are also supported in the position of the list. For example:

```sql
SELECT n.date_of_birth
  FROM g MATCH (n:Person)
 WHERE n.date_of_birth IN ? /* use PreparedStatement.setArray(int, java.util.List) */
```

# Subqueries

There are two types of subqueries:

 - [EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries](#exists-and-not-exists-subqueries).
 - [Scalar subqueries](#scalar-subqueries).

Both types of subqueries can be used as a value expression in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` and `ORDER BY` clauses. An `EXISTS` or `NOT EXISTS` subquery returns a boolean while a scalar subquery returns a value of any of the supported [data types](#data-types-and-literals).

## EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries

`EXISTS` returns true/false depending on whether the subquery produces at least one result, given the bindings obtained in the current (outer) query. No additional binding of variables occurs.

The syntax is as follows:

```bash
ExistsPredicate ::= 'EXISTS' <Subquery>

Subquery        ::= '(' <Query> ')'
```
An example is to find friend of friends, and, for each friend of friend, return the number of common friends:

```sql
SELECT fof.name, COUNT(friend) AS num_common_friends
  FROM g MATCH (p:Person) -[:has_friend]-> (friend:Person) -[:has_friend]-> (fof:Person)
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (
                    SELECT *
                     MATCH (p) -[:has_friend]-> (fof)
                  )
```

Here, vertices `p` and `fof` are passed from the outer query to the inner query. The `EXISTS` returns true if there is at least one `has_friend` edge between vertices `p` and `fof`.

Users can add a subquery in the `WHERE` clause of the `PATH` definition. One might be interested in asserting for specific properties for a vertex in the `PATH`. The following example defines a path ending in a vertex which is not the oldest in the graph:

```sql
  PATH p AS (a) -> (b) WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM g MATCH (x) WHERE x.age > b.age )
SELECT ...
  FROM ...
```

Topology related constraints can also be imposed. The following example defines a path ending in a vertex which has at least one outgoing edge to some neighbor `c`:

```sql
  PATH p AS (a) -> (b) WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM g MATCH (b) -> (c) )
SELECT ...
  FROM ...
```

## Scalar subqueries

Scalar subqueries are queries that return a scalar value (exactly one row and exactly one column) such that they can be part of an expression in a `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` or `ORDER BY` clause.

The syntax is:

```bash
ScalarSubquery ::= <Subquery>
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT a.name
  FROM g MATCH (a)
 WHERE a.age > ( SELECT AVG(b.age) MATCH (a) -[:friendOf]-> (b) )
```

Another example is:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/financial_transactions.png" %}

```sql
  SELECT p.name AS name
       , ( SELECT SUM(t.amount)
             FROM financial_transactions
            MATCH (a) <-[t:transaction]- (:Account)
         ) AS sum_incoming
       , ( SELECT SUM(t.amount)
             FROM financial_transactions
            MATCH (a) -[t:transaction]-> (:Account)
         ) AS sum_outgoing
       , ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p2)
             FROM financial_transactions
            MATCH (a) -[t:transaction]- (:Account) <-[:ownerOf]- (p2:Person)
            WHERE p2 <> p
         ) AS num_persons_transacted_with
       , ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c)
             FROM financial_transactions
            MATCH (a) -[t:transaction]- (:Account) <-[:ownerOf]- (c:Company)
         ) AS num_companies_transacted_with
    FROM financial_transactions
   MATCH (p:Person) -[:ownerOf]-> (a:Account)
ORDER BY sum_outgoing + sum_incoming DESC
```

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| name    | sum_incoming | sum_outgoing | num_persons_transacted_with | num_companies_transacted_with |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Nikita  | 9999.5       | 9900.0       | 1                           | 1                             |
| Camille | 9900.0       | 1000.0       | 2                           | 0                             |
| Liam    | 1000.0       | 4501.0       | 1                           | 1                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note that in the query, the graph name `financial_transactions` is repeatedly specified. Such repetition may be avoided by relying on a [default graph](#default-graphs) such that the query can be simplified to:

```sql
  SELECT p.name AS name
       , ( SELECT SUM(t.amount)
            MATCH (a) <-[t:transaction]- (:Account)
         ) AS sum_incoming
       , ( SELECT SUM(t.amount)
            MATCH (a) -[t:transaction]-> (:Account)
         ) AS sum_outgoing
       , ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p2)
            MATCH (a) -[t:transaction]- (:Account) <-[:ownerOf]- (p2:Person)
            WHERE p2 <> p
         ) AS num_persons_transacted_with
       , ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c)
            MATCH (a) -[t:transaction]- (:Account) <-[:ownerOf]- (c:Company)
         ) AS num_companies_transacted_with
   MATCH (p:Person) -[:ownerOf]-> (a:Account)
ORDER BY sum_outgoing + sum_incoming DESC
```

# Other Syntactic rules

## Identifiers

Identifiers (used for e.g. graph names, property names, etc.) take the form of an alphabetic character followed by zero or more alphanumeric or underscore (i.e. `_`) characters.

The syntax is:

```bash
IDENTIFIER           ::= [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\_]*
```

TODO: update.

### Special characters in property names, graph names, and labels

Identifiers like graph names, property names, and labels can be delimited with double quotes to allow for encoding of special characters (e.g. the space in the property name `n."my prop"`).
Any Unicode character may be used inside the delimiters.

## Lexical constructs for literals

The following are the lexical grammar constructs:

```bash
SINGLE_QUOTED_STRING ::= "'" ( ~[\'\n\\] | <ESCAPED_CHARACTER> )* "'"

UNSIGNED_INTEGER     ::= [0-9]+

UNSIGNED_DECIMAL     ::= ( [0-9]* '.' [0-9]+ ) | ( [0-9]+ '.' )
```

These rules describe the following:

 - Single quoted strings (used for string literals) consist of:
     - A starting single quote.
     - Any number of characters that are either:
         - Not single quote characters, new line characters, or backslash characters.
         - Escaped characters.
     - An ending single quote.
 - Unsigned integers consist of one or more digits.
 - Unsigned decimals consist of zero or more digits followed by a dot (`.`) and one or more digits, or, one or more digits followed by only a dot (`.`).

## Escaped characters

Escaping in string literals and identifiers is necessary to support white space, quotation marks, and backslash characters.

The syntax is:

```bash
ESCAPED_CHARACTER ::= '\\' [tnr\"\'\\]
```

TODO: fix the grammar.

Note that an escaped character is either a tab (`\t`), a line feed (`\n`), a carriage return (`\r`), a single (`\'`) or double quote (`\"`), or a backslash (`\\`). Corresponding Unicode code points are shown in the table below.

Escape | Unicode code point
--- | ---
`\t` | U+0009 (tab)
`\n` | U+000A (line feed)
`\r` | U+000D (carriage return)
`\"` | U+0022 (quotation mark, double quote mark)
`\'` | U+0027 (apostrophe-quote, single quote mark)
`\\` | U+005C (backslash)

TODO: fix the table.

In string literals, it is optional to escape double quotes.

For example:

```sql
'abc\"d\"efg' = 'abc"d"efg'
Result: true
```

In addition to Java-like escaping, string literals in PGQL queries can be escaped in a SQL-like fashion by repeating the quote.
For example, `n.prop = 'string''value'` is an alternative for `n.prop = 'string\'value'`, and `FROM "my""graph"` is an alternative for `FROM "my\"graph"`.

## Keywords

The following is a list of keywords in PGQL.

```sql
PATH, SELECT, FROM, MATCH, WHERE, GROUP, BY,
HAVING, ORDER, ASC, DESC, LIMIT, OFFSET,
AND, OR, NOT, true, false, IS, NULL, AS,
DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, WITH, ZONE, DISTINCT,
COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM, ARRAY_AGG, IN,
EXISTS, CAST, CASE, WHEN, THEN, ELSE, END,
EXTRACT, YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE,
SECOND, TIMEZONE_HOUR, TIMEZONE_MINUTE,
TOP, SHORTEST
```

Keywords are case-insensitive and variations such as `SELECT`, `Select` and `sELeCt` can be used interchangeably.

## Comments

Comments are delimited by `/*` and `*/`.

The syntax is:

```bash
COMMENT ::= '/*' ~[\*]* '*/'
```

For example:

```sql
/* This is a
   multi-line
   comment. */
SELECT n.name, n.age
  FROM g MATCH (n:Person) /* this is a single-line comment */
```
