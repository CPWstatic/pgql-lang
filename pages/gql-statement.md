## Towards GQL: a standard for property graph querying

GQL is the name of a newly proposed ANSI/ISO standard query language for property graphs developed by same committees that have been standardizing ANSI/ISO SQL for more than three decades. For more details, see [https://www.gqlstandards.org/](https://www.gqlstandards.org/).

Oracle is committed to working together with the graph community on developing GQL and to further the adoption and the growth of graph database technology in general.

Oracle also intends to make the necessary improvements to align PGQL with GQL as part of Oracle Spatial and Graph, Oracle Big Data Spatial and Graph, and Oracle's Graph Cloud offerings. This will likely happen incrementally over time.

We invite everyone to join the collaboration on GQL.
